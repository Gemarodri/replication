    "UseOF-SZZ": " Their method is different from the SZZ in two points (1) They accept false positives but they try to avoid false negatives
     (2) their methos focuses on the question: 'which versions are truly affected by which vulnerabilities?'",
    "Summary": " A new method inspired by SZZ ",
    "Outcome": " The experiment showed that there is a significant presence of spurious vulnerability claims in NVD"
