    "UseOF-SZZ": " The SZZ algorithm matches the fault fix described in the bug tracking system with corresponding commits 
    in the version control system that fixed that fault",

    "Outcome": " The results show that our proposal can significantly (p â‰¤ 0.05) improve fault prediction performance"
