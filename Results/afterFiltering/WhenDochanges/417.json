    "Summary": "To evaluate the utility of BugCache as a tool for focusing inspection, they examine the assumptions underlying 
    BugCache with the aim of improving it, and finally to compare it with a simple, standard bug-prediction technique.",
    "Outcome": " BugCache is, in fact, useful for focusing inspection effort; but surprisingly, they find that its performance, when used for inspections, is
not much better than a naive prediction model"
