    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"Yes",
    "Design":"quantitative",
    "Collection": [""],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "To link bugs report with issues. they work at file level not commit level so the TTV are less",
    "Summary": " They empirically investigate the effectiveness of a large space of classifier configurations, 3,172 in total. ",
    "Outcome": " The parameters of a classifier have a significant impact on its performance. Second, we show that combining multiple classifiers improves the performance of even the best individual classifiers"
