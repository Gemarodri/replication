    "Summary": "to predict latent bugs of source code changes accurately, especially in the long-term prediction scenario. In order to 
    deal with this problem, a feature-based incremental learning framework is proposed. ",
    "Outcome": " The approach performs better than the non-incremental method in dealing with concept drift, with the consideration 
    of keeping the value of both precision and recall stable at a suitable level over time"
