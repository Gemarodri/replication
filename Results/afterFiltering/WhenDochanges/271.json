that were changed by the associated fixing change. Once the changed lines are identi-
fied, we use Gitâ€™s blame command to trace back to the last revision that changed those
lines. This way, we have a mapping of each fixing change to a fix-inducing change. ",

    "Summary": " One aspect of this research focuses on predicting software changes that are fix-inducing.
    They study high impact fix-inducing changes (HIFCs). Since the impact of a change can be measured in different ways,",
    "Outcome": " They are able to predict 56 % to 77 % of HIFCs with an average false alarm (misclassification) rate of 16 %."
