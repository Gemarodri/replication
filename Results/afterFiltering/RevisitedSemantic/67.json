    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify fault fix locations and investigate the fault proneness of anti-pattern mutations.",
    "Summary": " the paper presents results from an empirical study aimed at understanding
the evolution of anti-patterns in 27 releases of three open-source
software systems",
    "Outcome": "(1)anti-patterns mutate from one type of anti-patterns to another, (2) structural
changes are behind these mutations, and (3) some mutations are
more risky in terms of fault-proneness. "
