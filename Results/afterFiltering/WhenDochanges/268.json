    "UseOF-SZZ": "Similar heuristics to map commits and ids, to identify fault fix locations and change",
    "Summary": " We investigate the impact of such dependencies in object-oriented systems by studying the relations between the presence of static and co-change dependencies and (1) the fault-proneness, (2) the types of changes, and (3) the types of faults that these classes exhib",
    "Outcome": "  (1) static dependencies with anti-pattern classes do have a negative impact on changes and faults and (2) co-change dependencies with anti-pattern and design pattern classes have similar negative impacts on changes and faul"
