    "Summary": " a defect prediction approach centered on more robust evidences towards causality between source code metrics (as 
    predictors) and the occurrence of defects",
    "Outcome": " reached an average precision greater than 50% in three out of the four systems we evaluated. Moreover, 
    by comparing our approach with baselines that are not based on causality tests, it achieved a better precision."
