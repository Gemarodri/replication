    "Summary": " The aim to understand the effect of collaboration on the defect proneness software.They model the collaboration of developers as an undirected network." ,
    "Outcome": " Centrality and source code change activity of developers in the collaboration network may change their defect induction rates. Also, Contrary to the common perception, more experienced people have relatively higher defect induction rates."
