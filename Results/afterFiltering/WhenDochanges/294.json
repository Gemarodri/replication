    "Summary": " Examining the relation between self- admitted technical debt and software quality",
    "Outcome": " (1)there is no clear trend when it comes to defects and self-admitted technical debt, although the defectiveness of the
    technical debt files increases after the introduction of technical debt, (2) self-admitted technical debt changes induce less future
    defects than none technical debt changes"
