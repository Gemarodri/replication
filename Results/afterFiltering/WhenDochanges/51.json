    "Purpose":"This paper focuses on the power of comments to predict fault-prone program  ",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" The method could be not buggy as they said causing that the linear regression model is wrong",

    "UseOF-SZZ": "They comment in the introduction the keyword matching approach of SZZ. But they use the idea of SZZ when they say that we decided that a change was for fixing a bug if the corresponding commitment log included one of the words related to bug fixing—“bug,”“fix” and “defect.” ",
    "Summary": "  This paper conducts an empirical analysis to examine whether Lines of Comments (LCM) written inside a method’s body is a noteworthy metric for analyzing fault-proneness in Java method",
    "Outcome": " More-commented methods are more likely to be faulty than the others. LCM can be a useful factor in fault-prone method prediction models along with the method size and the method complexity"
