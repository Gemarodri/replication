    "Summary": " Twenty-seven automatically extractable bug fix patterns are defined using the
syntax components and context of the source code involved in bug fix changes",
    "Outcome": " A correlation analysis on the extracted pattern instances on the seven projects shows that six have very similar bug fix
pattern frequencies. There appear to be broad mechanisms causing the
injection of bugs that are largely independent of the type of software being produced"
