    "UseOF-SZZ": "They used a tool call defect Extractor which parses the commit logs of projects and identifies the software
    changes which introduced the defects/bugs in the system",
    "UsedTool": "Defect Extractor",
    "Summary": " The impact of architecture on the evolution of software from its change history. to examine if co-changes spanning
    multiple architecture modules are more likely to introduce bugs than co-changes that are within modules",
    "Outcome": "The results show that the co-changes that cross architectural module boundaries are
more correlated with defects than co-changes within modules, implying that, to improve accuracy, bug predictors should also
take the software architecture of the system into consideration "
