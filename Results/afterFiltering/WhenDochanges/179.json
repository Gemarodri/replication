    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify the patch that originally introduced the porting error",
    "Summary": "To understand the extent and characteristic of porting errors in practice, we analyze the version histories for Linux and FreeBSD. Developers often document fixes to porting errors in commit messages.",
    "ToolUsed":"REPERTOIRE",
    "Outcome": "The cross-system porting happens periodically and the porting rate does not necessarily decrease over time."
