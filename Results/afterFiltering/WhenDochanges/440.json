    "Summary": " we propose a concerted set of visualization tools and techniques for the assessment
of software evolution based on the information stored into SCM systems.",
    "Outcome": "We demonstrate our techniques with several use cases performed on
real world, industry-size code bases and outline the concrete findings and ways our visualizations helped in understanding various
types of code changes. "
