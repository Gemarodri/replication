    "Summary": " provide detailed signature change properties by analyzing seven software project histories 
    to reveal multiple properties of signature changes, including their kind, frequency, correlation with 
    other changes, number of parameter changes, and evolution patterns of signature change kinds.",
    "Outcome": "They show that signature changes can be used as measurement aid for software evolution analysis "
