    "Elements_risk_assessment":"It's not a paper about the location of the bug, and they don't see commits. They are interested in linking/mapping",

    "UseOF-SZZ": "To identify bugs and to compare how the defect-fixing changes are recorded",
    "Summary": " The aim is design a framework that automates the process of synchronizing and filling the gaps of the development logs and bug issue data for open source software projects.",
    "Outcome": "They designed an automatic approach to re-align the two databases, filling the gaps"
