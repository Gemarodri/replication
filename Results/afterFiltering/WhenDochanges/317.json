    "Summary": "The types of porting errors found in practice, and (2) how to detect and characterize potential porting errors. ",
    "Outcome": " SPA can detect porting inconsistencies with 65% to 73% precision and 90 % recall, and identify inconsistency
    types with 58% to 63 % precision and 92% to 100 % recall."
