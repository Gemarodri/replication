    "Summary": " Empirical methodology that evaluates the performance of vulnerability discovery models along to quality and predictability",
    "Outcome": " it shows that the results obtained by the proposed methodology are more informative than those by the traditional methodology. Among evaluated VDMs, the simplest linear model is the most appropriate choice in terms of both quality and predictability for the first 6-12 months since a release date. Otherwise, logistics-based models are better choic"
