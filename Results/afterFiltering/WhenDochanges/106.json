    "Summary": " To evaluate the relationship between lexical smells and software quality as well as their interaction with design smells. They analyze to what extent classes containing lexical smells have higher (or lower) odds to change or to be subject to fault fixing 
    than other classes containing design smells",
    "ToolUSED": "DECOR",
    "Outcome": " Lexical smells can make, in some cases, classes with design smells more fault-prone. (2) empirically demonstrate that classes containing design smells only are more change-
    and fault-prone than classes with lexical smells only"
