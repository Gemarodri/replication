    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify bug-fixing commits, and trace bug fixing commits to the time when a bug was introduced",
    "Summary": " This paper analyzes the behaviour of the FixCache algorithm on four open source projects.",
    "Outcome": " FixCache hit rate is found to generally increase over time for three of the four projects; file duration in cache follows 
    a Zipf distribution; and topmost bug-fixed files go through periods of greater and lesser stability over a projectâ€™s history"
