    "Summary": " adaptive fault prediction approach that exploits existing prediction techniques, adapting them to improve
    their ability to predict faulty system modules across different software projects",
    "Outcome": " (1) discovery and understanding of deeper issues surrounding the challenges of software OO metrics as related 
    to the fault prediction techniques; (2) development of reusable and adaptable approach to fault prediction applicable across different software projects"
