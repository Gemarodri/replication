    "Summary": " to validate the reliability of the NVD vulnerable version data. In this experiment, they verify 
    for each version of Chrome that NVD claims vulnerable is actually vulnerable.",
    "Outcome": " The experiment revealed several errors in the vulnerability data of Chrome.
     Also, different conclusions could be obtained due to the data errors."
