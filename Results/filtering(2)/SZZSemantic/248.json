    "Summary": " techniques to effectively mine software repositories, identify significant patterns during software
development and maintenance, and recommend actionable aspects that can automate the
decision-making process in software engineering.",
    "Outcome": " framework can achieve high-levels of
prediction accuracies for different types of decision-making problems when tested on large,
widely-used, real-world, long-lived software projects."
