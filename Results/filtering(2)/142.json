    "Summary": " Examining the characteristics of highlyimpactful bugs in Mozilla Firefox and Fennec for Android, and 
    propose statistical models to help software organisations predict them early on before they impact a large population of users.",
    "Outcome": " triaging and predicting highly-impactful bugs early (before a new release of a software system) can help reduce a 
    large amount of crashes experienced by users, which could improve the overall quality of the software system in a more cost-effective manner"
