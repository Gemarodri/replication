    "Summary": " Analyze the impacts of UML modeling, specifically the production of class and sequence diagrams, on the quality of the code, as measured by defect density, and on defect resolution time.",
    "Outcome": " The  results  confirm  that  not  only  does  the production  of  UML  class  diagrams  and  sequence  diagrams  possibly  help  improve the quality of software, but also it possibly help increase the productivity in software maintenance"
