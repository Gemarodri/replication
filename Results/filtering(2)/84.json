    "Summary": "  Building a prototype fault-prone module prediction tool using a text-filtering based technique named (Fault Prone Filtering)",
    "Outcome": " The tool could detect 90 percent of the actual fault modules (i.e., the recall of 0.9) with the accuracy of 0.67 and the precision of 0.63 on average"
