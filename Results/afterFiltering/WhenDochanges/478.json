    "Summary": " propose to extract system specific rules by mining systematic changes over source code history,
i.e., not just from bug-fixes or system releases, to ensure that
changes are consistently applied over source code.",
    "Outcome": " The results show that specific rules are more precise in identifying real violations
in source code than generic ones, and thus can complement them."
