    "Summary": " Calculating the threshold-derived risk to (a) the probability that a file would have a defect, and (b) the defect density of the files in the high-risk group.",
    "Outcome": "Risk thresholds for size and complexity metrics have to be
used with caution if at all. Our findings have immediate practical implications: the redistribution of Java code into smaller and less complex files may be counterproductive. "
