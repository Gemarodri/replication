    "Purpose":" It proposes a rule reduction technique that can eliminate complex (long) and/or similar rules without sacrificing the prediction performance as much as possible. ",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" pc is not the BIC",
    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"No",
    "Design":"qualitative",
    "Collection": [""],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "We obtained the number of bugs in source code files using the SZZ algorithm",
    "Summary": " Removing long and similar rules unless their confidence level as a heuristic is high enough than shorter rules.",
    "Outcome": " The proposed method reduced the number of rules providing better understanding of the causes of faulty modules. "
