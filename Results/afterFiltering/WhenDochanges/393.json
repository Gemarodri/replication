    "Summary": " To build a change risk model, they use a wide range of factors based on the
characteristics of a software change, such as the number of added lines, and developer experience.",
    "Outcome": "“Just-In-Time Quality Assurance” may provide an effort-reducing way to focus on
the most risky changes and thus reduce the costs of developing high-quality software."
