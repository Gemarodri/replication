    "Summary": " Build a prediction model based on the fact that focused developers are less prone to introduce defects than non focused developers",
    "Outcome": " The achieved results show the superiority of their model with respect to the two competitive approaches, and the complementarity of the defined scattering measures with respect to standard predictors commonly used in the literature."
