    "UseOF-SZZ": "We similar identify changes, but
differ in how we identify fault-inducing changes. Our
approach is based on the semantic analysis on the
changes and their interference, while [18] focuses on
mining version histories and bug databases.",
    "Summary": "empirical study on the semantic
interference detection algorithm in the context of a
large industrial project. ",
    "Outcome": "Our approach detects a significant portion of the
faults in these changes; "
