    "Summary": "Introducing the concept of a failure-associated type to represent the imported types referenced within methods fixed due to failures. they created a new method to identify the cause/origin of the bug",
    "Outcome": " The results indicate that few of the types or packages imported by a failure-prone component are associated with its failures"
