    "Summary": " exploratory study on three large open source systems that aims at investigating the influence of code review on (i) the chances of inducing bug fixes and (ii)
the quality of the committed code components, as assessed by code coupling, complexity, and readability.",
    "Outcome": " unreviewed commits have over two times more
chances of introducing bugs than reviewed commits"
