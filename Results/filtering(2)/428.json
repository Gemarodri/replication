    "UseOF-SZZ": "Bug-introducing changes are identified by mining change logs and project history data",
    "Summary": " They observed the micro pattern evolution properties of three open source projects, including frequencies of micro 
    patterns, common micro pattern evolution kinds, and bug-prone micro patterns",
    "Outcome": " The micro pattern distributions and common change kinds of analyzed projects are similar.
    The bug rates of patterns of different projects are somewhat similar"
