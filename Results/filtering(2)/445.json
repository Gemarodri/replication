    "Summary": " They investigate the relationship between faults and five of Fowler et al.â€™s least-studied smells in code",
    "Outcome": " results suggest that Switch Statements had no effect on faults in any of the three systems; Message Chains 
    increased faults in two systems; Message Chains which occurred in larger files reduced faults;"
