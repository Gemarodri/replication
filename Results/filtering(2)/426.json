    "Purpose":" Empirical study",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" SZZ assumes the fault was injected by the developer in the lines 
    identified as modified or deleted",
    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"No",
    "Design":"quantitative&qualitative",
    "Collection": [""],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "To find when and who inject the bug",
    "Summary": " Empirical study to analyze relationships between faults ain source code and some 
    developer metrics that can be derived from a software repository",
    "Outcome": " fault injection rate varies among different developers and the modules touched
    by more developer contained more faults."
