    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify those changes which actually introduced the bug",
    "Summary": " They use the probability of bug introducing and bug fix-introducing
changes to identify the source file as being risky or not for further changes.",
    "Outcome": " presented a database schema and a way for
calculating the risk value for a file, The files which
have higher risk values are more risky when applying
the next change and thus should be tested more thoroughly."
