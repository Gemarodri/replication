    "Summary": " Determine the reasons why DICA is not used more often by practitioners",
    "Outcome": " Current repository mining methods are too immature for
successful DICA. Gradual improvements are unlikely to help; different principles of operation will be required. Even with such
different techniques, issues with input data quality may continue to make good results difficult-to-have"
