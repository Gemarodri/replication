    "Elements_risk_assessment":" We consider a CU as affected by a bug when it is modified for bug fixing.
    Note that a “bug” reported in a bug management system has a broad sense. It may denote a
true error in the code, but also an enhancement of the system, or fixing a requirement error, not
a coding error.",

    "Summary": " The study is centered on quality analysis of the systems, measured as defects absence, and its relation with software metrics
evolution.",
    "Outcome": " They propose a
metrics suite for Java files based on Chidamber and Kemerer suite, and use it to study software
evolution and its relationship with bug count."
