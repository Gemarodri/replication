    "Summary": " Improve the unserstanding of the performance degradation phenomenon by studying specific characteristics of commits
    that can affect the likehood of introducing this problem.",
    "Outcome": " Number of days before release and day of week were the most relevant variables of commits that cause performance in 
    their model. Also they didn't find any relationship between the commit size and its probability to cause performance degradation"
