    "UseOF-SZZ": " they have the similar idea than us about the SZZ and the buggy parts in a fixed commit. They said that not all fixed hunks are bug-fix hunks",
    "Summary": " Their goal is to remove the non-fix hunks in the bug-fix revisions automatically",
    "Outcome": " A list of cases when the previous lines didn't cause the fix-bug. They want to answer  'which hunks are non-fix hunks?' and 'how can we detect non-fix hunks?'. We found that there are many patterns which require semantic analysis and therefore not recognizable by the previous approaaches"
