    "UseOF-SZZ": "They for sure use the first part of the SZZ but the second part is used in a implicit way",
    "Summary": " propose a novel methodology which controls for development
process and developer competence, and quantifies how the choice of programming language impacts software quality and developer
productivity.",
    "Outcome": " found that using C++ instead of C results in improved software quality
and reduced maintenance effort, and that code bases are shifting from C to C++."
