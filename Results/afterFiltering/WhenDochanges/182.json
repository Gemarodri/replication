    "UseOF-SZZ": "To locate bug inducing changes",
    "Summary": " To predict bug inducing changes by using source code differences of bug inducing changes and previous changes and a text filtering technique",
    "Outcome": "the recall fell a little, and precision and F 1 value improved a little. In particular, the granularity of prediction is finer, and
    the accuracy of prediction is higher. "
