    "Summary": " An empirical study on bug inducing analysis to discover the types and features of fault prone bug fixes. They analyze the statistics to find out what types of change are most prone to
induce new bugs when they are intended to fix a bug",
    "Outcome": " that the codeAdded and codeChanged changes, especially addition or modification of the if conditional statements in bug-fix commits are apt to cause more bugs in the future."
