    "Purpose":" Bug classification",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" We mark those hunks as bug introducing in which we find the source code involved
    in a bug fix.",

    "Collection": [""],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "To identify the bug introducing hunks, we identify first the bug introducing changes by using the SZZ algorithm",
    "Summary": "an approach for bug prediction at the smallest level of granularity. ",
    "Outcome": " The classification approach can classify hunks as buggy or bug free with 81 percent accu-
racy, 77 percent buggy hunk precision and 67 percent buggy hunk recall on average"
