    "Purpose":"automatically predict the fault-prone files from bug reports. They have addressed a novel mechanism of exploiting module locality based on the previously fixed files.",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":"They did not say anything about that the pc could be not the real ones",
    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"Yes",

    "Collection": ["Tigris","Bugzilla","Tigris"],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "To identify the fixed components in the source files, the fixed information was retrieved from CVS/SVN and the bug repositories as in previous studies",
    "Summary": " Our empirical observations show that the files of low revision frequencies in the same file directory or package of the files of high revision  
frequencies may be potential bug-fixing candidates for future bug reports. In this paper, we present a novel enhancement by exploiting module locality to improve the frequency-based approaches",
    "Outcome": " module locality can be employed to consistently improve the hit rate of a frequency-based approach and achieve the highest improvement of about 14%"
