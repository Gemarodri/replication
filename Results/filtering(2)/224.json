    "Summary": " empirically evaluate the use of hunk metrics as predictor of bugs. resent a technique for bug prediction
that works at smallest units of code change called hunksOur classifier
can classify individual hunks as buggy or bug-free with 86 % accuracy,
83 % buggy hunk precision and 77% buggy hunk recall.",
    "Outcome": " Our classifier
can classify individual hunks as buggy or bug-free with 86 % accuracy,
83 % buggy hunk precision and 77% buggy hunk recall."
