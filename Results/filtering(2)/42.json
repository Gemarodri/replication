    "Summary": " propose an approach of context-aware rank transformation to mitigate the large
variations in the distribution of software metrics across projects of diverse contexts.  They said that it is feasible to generalize defect prediction models. ",
    "Outcome": "Aggregation can significantly impact both the correlation among software metrics
and the correlation between software metrics and defect count. "
