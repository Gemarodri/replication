    "UseOF-SZZ": "They extract bugs and the faulty lines of code that are responsible for them",
    "Summary": " To what extent could field defects be found and detected by state of the art static bug-finding tools?. They analyze 3 bug finding tools on three diferent programs",
    "Outcome": "  Although many field defects could be detected by static bug finding tools, a substantial proportion of defects could not be flagge. FindBugs and PMD are the best among the three bug findings tools in preventing false negatives"
