    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"No",
    "Design":"quantitative&qualitative",
    "Collection": ["Bugzilla"],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "to dentify when a bug was injected into the code and who injected it",
    "Summary": " They revisit two common findings in the bug prediction literature: 1) Process metrics
     outperform product metrics, 2) Package-level predictions outperform file-level predictions",
    "Outcome": "the first finding holds when effort is considered, while the second finding does not hold. These findings validate the practical
significance of prior findings in the bug prediction literature and encourage their adoption in practice "
