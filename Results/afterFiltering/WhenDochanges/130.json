    "Purpose":" Quality Assurance/Desect-prone model",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" SZZ assumes that a bug fix only changes the source code lines that had a defect and that the most recent 
    commit(s) that changed those lines were the defect-introducing commit(s).",

    "Design":"quantitative",
    "Collection": ["Bugzilla/Launchpad"],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify the defect-introducing commits in our case study systems.",
    "Summary": " Building logistic regression models to study the impact of the characteristics of issue and review discussions on the defect-proneness of a patch.",
    "Outcome": " Issue and review metrics combined improve precision and recall of the explanatory models up to 10%"
