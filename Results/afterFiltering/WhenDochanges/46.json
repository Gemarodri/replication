    "Purpose":" To identify previously unknown vulnerabilities automatically using information gathered from development metadata",

    "Summary": "  This paper provides a method for leveraging development metadata to find bugs that would otherwise be difficult to find using standard static analysis tools",
    "Outcome": "  It is possible to identify new vulnerabilities that are similar to previously reported vulnerabilities within that application"
