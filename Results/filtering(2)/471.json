Rdate(bi), we can assume that they are bug-introducing regions.",

    "UseOF-SZZ": "To identify faulty modules",
    "Summary": " They prepared a naive Bayes classifier and a logistic regression model as detection model",
    "Outcome": " The results imply that large-scale text features are useful in constructing practical detection models,
    and measuring sophisticated metrics is not always necessary for detecting fault-prone modules."
