    "Summary": " They conducted an experiment to show the effect of new metric. The result suggested that use of new metric as well as conventional metrics is effective for accuracy of fault-prone module prediction. ",
    "Outcome": " An approach to detect fault-prone modules using the spam-filtering technique, using a new metric. "
