    "Summary": "developed a fine-grained version control system for Java, Historage. With this system, we target
    Java software and conduct fine-grained prediction with well-known historical metrics.",
    "UseOF-SZZ": " To identify buggy module",
    "Outcome": "fine-grained (method-level) prediction outperforms coarse-grained (package
    and file levels) prediction when taking the efforts necessary to find bugs into account. "
