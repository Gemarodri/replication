    "Purpose":" Defect prediction",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":"Registered defects found in version n+1, were used for prediction preci-
sion validation and – again – for training data creation to be used for prediction in
version n+2, ",

    "Summary": " It reports on dedicated R&D project to research possibilities of introduction of software defect prediction using an open source, extensible software measurement and
defect prediction framework called DePress",
    "Outcome": " With the growth and maturation of developed applications, small discrepancies or negligences can turn into serious quality
or project-related knowledge issues – like presented in this work 62% lack of version information in registered defects"
