    "Summary": " the role of refactorings has not been systematically investigatedusing fine-grained evolution history.
    They studied API-level refactorings and bug fixes in Eclipse JDT coret,""hree large open source projects",
    "Outcome": " (1)there is an increase in the number of bug fixes after API-level refactorings.
    (2)the time taken to fix bugs is shorter after API-level refactorings than before."
