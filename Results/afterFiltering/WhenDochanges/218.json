    "Summary": " It presents the details necessary to use survival analysis in the context of defect modelling (such details were missing from the original paper by Koru et al.)",
    "Outcome": " defect density has an inverted “U” shaped pattern. their findings generally agree with the results of Koru 
    et al., who found that defect density decreases as module size increases."
