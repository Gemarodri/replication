    "Purpose":"New approach",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":"They use SZZ as is described in the article, using git blame to see which was the last commit touched the fixed line",

    "Design":"qualitative",
    "Collection": ["Bugzilla"],
    "UseOF-SZZ": "They used the SZZ to map bugs with fixes",
    "Summary": " They proposed an approach to mine a change history to improve the bug localization performance",
    "Outcome": " Their proposed approach can improve the bug localization performance and effectively identify buggy files and the experimental results show that our approach can improve the  bug localization performance and more effectively identify buggy files."
