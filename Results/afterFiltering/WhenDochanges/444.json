    "Summary": " They evaluate these two disparate approaches on a similar footing.
    We use historical defect data to apprise the two approaches, compare them, and seek synergies.",
    "Outcome": "under some accounting principles, they provide comparable benefits; they also find that 
    in some settings, the performance of certain static bug-finders can be enhanced using information pro-
vided by statistical defect prediction. "
