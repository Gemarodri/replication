    "UseOF-SZZ": "To evaluate it, they extract the PC looking for the BIC and also descard some of them based on their three criteria",
    "Summary": "The framework evaluates the following criteria: (1) the earliest bug appearance, (2) the future impact of changes, and (3) the realism of bug introduction.
    We use the proposed framework to evaluate five SZZ implementations using data from ten open source projects",
    "Outcome": "framework provides a systematic mean for evaluating the data that is generated by a given SZZ implementation"
