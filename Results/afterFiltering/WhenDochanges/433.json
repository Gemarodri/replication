    "Elements_risk_assessment":" Whenever we find that a method was changed between two revisions of a file  and the commit mes-
sage contains a bug reference, we consider the method to be affected by the bug",
    "EaseOf_Reproducibility":"Yes",

    "Summary": " present bug prediction models at the level of individual methods
rather than at file-level.",
    "UsedTool":"ChangeDestiller",
    "Outcome": " prediction models reach a precision and recall of 84% and 88%, respectively. Furthermore, the
results indicate that change metrics significantly outperform
source code metrics."
