    "Summary": "We conduct statistical analysis to investigate the relationship between
the origins, product metrics, the number of modifications, and defects. ",
    "Outcome": " Files that are modified by multiple organizations or developed by later 
    organizations tend to be faultier due to the increase in complexity and modification frequency."
