    "Summary": " They focus on factors that could potentially hinder developers’ ability to correctly understand the code components involved in the change to be committed as fo llows: (i) the coherence of the commit (i.e.,
how much it is focused on a speciﬁc topic); (ii) the experience level of the developer on the ﬁles involved in the commit; and (iii) the interfering changes performed by other developers on the ﬁles involved in past commits. ",
    "Outcome": "‘ﬁx-inducing’ commits are performed by more experienced developers; yet, those are the developers perform ing more complex changes in the system. ‘ﬁx-inducing’ commits have a higher number of past interfering changes as compared with ‘clean ’ commits"
