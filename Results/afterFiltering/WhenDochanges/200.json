    "Summary": " We build and estimate regression models to assess individual developersâ€™ learning
progress (in reducing the likelihood they make a bug). ",
    "Outcome": " The results have implications on project management about how to split efforts on tasks that add new codes versus tasks that debug and fix existing codes. "
