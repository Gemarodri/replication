    "Summary": " They examine the relationship between diferent ownership measures and software faults/failures in three large software projects drawn from diferent process domains",
    "Outcome": " Measures of ownership such as the number of low-expertise developers, and the proportion of ownership for the top owner have a relationship with both pre-release faults and post-release failures.
    However, the strength of the efects is related to the development process used. The more that a project uses an open source style process,the more that team sizes rather than ownership levels affect to failures."
