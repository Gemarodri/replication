    "UseOF-SZZ": "It uses the first part of SZZ (to Mapping Vulnerabilities to Components )and created a new second part based on test",
    "Summary": " It propose a new method of analyzing intrusions: instead of analyzing evidence and deducing what must have happened, 
    it find the intrusion-causing circumstances by a series of automatic experiments",
    "Outcome": "a distribution of vulnerabilities across the entire codebase. The number of past vulnerability reports is not a good predictor for future reports, 
    because it would miss all the components that have only one report"
