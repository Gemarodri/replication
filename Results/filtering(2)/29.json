    "UseOF-SZZ": "They created a bug database to test SZZ, they used SZZ to map bugs and commits",
    "Summary": " They selected 15 Java projects from GitHub to construct a public bug database from. Also, they matched the already known and fixed bugs with the corresponding source code elements (classes and files) and calculated a wide set of product metrics on these elements.",
    "Outcome": " They calculated the bug coverage ratio on every project for every machine learning algorithm. They obtained very high and promising bug coverage values (up to 100 %)."
