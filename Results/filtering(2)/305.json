    "Summary": " A dynamic programming based algorithm to optimally segment an item-set time series is presented. The algorithm au-
tomatically produces a compacted item-set time series that can be analyzed to discern temporal patterns.",
    "Outcome": " the segmentation algorithm produces segments that capture meaningful information and is superior to the information
content obtaining by arbitrarily segmenting time period into regular time intervals"
