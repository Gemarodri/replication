    "Summary": " Using version history, they examine contributions to code fragments that are actually repaired to fix bugs. 
    Are these code fragments “implicated” in bugs the result of contributions from many? or from one? Does experience matter? 
    What type of experience?",
    "Outcome": " implicated code is more strongly associated with a single developer’s contribution; their findings also indicate 
    that an author’s specialized experience in the target file is more important than general experience."
