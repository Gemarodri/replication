    "UseOF-SZZ": "to identify bugs and to compare how the defect-fixing changes are recorded",
    "Summary": " The aim is design a framework that automates the process of synchronizing and filling the gaps of the development logs and bug issue data for open source software projects.",
    "Outcome": "They propose an algorithm to locate and rank buggy files using crash correlation groups, also they propose a method to identify duplicate and related bug reports"
