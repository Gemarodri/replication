    "Summary": " computes a fine-grained edit script describing
    changes within a change set,identifies changes that we consider to be non-essential,and identifies subtasks within change sets, or groups of changes that are related to each other, but unrelated to other groups of changes within the same change set",
    "Outcome": "Proposed a catalog of non-essential changes and describe an automated technique for detecting such changes within version histories, between 3% and 26% of all modified code lines and between 2% and 16% of all method updates consisted entirely of non-essential modifications. "
