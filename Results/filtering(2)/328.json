    "Summary": " study the correlation between a commit’s bugginess and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, the commit
    frequency and seniority of the commit authors, and whether or not the developers have marked a commit as a “stable” commit",
    "Outcome": " (1)commits between midnight and 4 AM are significantly buggier and commits between 8 AM and noon are less buggy
    (2) daily-committing developers produce less-buggy commits, (3) the bugginess of commits versus day-of-week varies for different software projects"
