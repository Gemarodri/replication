    "Summary": " This paper describes the experimental framework we developed to conduct the studies, the metrics we adopted and developed to measure the degree of scattering, the studies we
performed, the efforts we undertook to remove experimental and other biases, and the results we obtained.",
    "Outcome": " All three studies revealed a moderate to strong statistically significant
correlation between the degree of scattering and the number of defects."
