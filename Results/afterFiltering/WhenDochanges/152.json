    "Elements_risk_assessment":"we can assume that in most cases we will at least have a reasonable connection between bug-introducing and bug-fixing commits. ",

    "Summary": " We discussed the problems of different levels of granularity. Our method begins at a high level of detail and then differentiates 
    between files based on the temporal characteristics of their changes.",
    "Outcome": " The measure of structural change in concert with its complement, churn, effectively indicates fault-proneness in classes."
