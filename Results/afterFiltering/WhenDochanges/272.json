    "Purpose":" to investigate the practical application of the text and dependence approaches for discovering the origins of bugs.",
    "Elements_risk_assessment":" For each line altered in the fix the version it was previously altered 
    in is considered a possible origin of the bug",

    "Summary": " The study was performed by manually simulating both of the approaches on sets of bugs from three case studies: Eclipse, Rachota and jEdit.",
    "Outcome": " Taking the most recent version as that which introduced the bug may not be the most
effective technique "
