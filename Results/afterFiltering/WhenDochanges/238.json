command supported by SVN, we identify the bug- introducing revision that brings this buggy code chunk
to the module. ",

    "Summary": "a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast
to predict the bug information of hardware designs. ",
    "Outcome": "about 90% modules
could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number
of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted. "
