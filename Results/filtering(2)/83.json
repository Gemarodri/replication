    "UseOF-SZZ": " The error-causing commits were extracted with an algorithm that resembles the SZZ algorithm",
    "Summary": " To improve the efficiency of testing and other quality tools by using a machine learner. The error predictions are used for prioritizing the test cases that are most probably going to find an error",
    "Outcome": " a predictor that is capable of estimating which of the file changes are most likely to cause an error. The prediction information is 
    used for creating reports such as a ranking of the most probably error-causing commits"
